<b><h1>Hi, I'm Vito! ðŸ‘‹</h1></b>

Right now, I only know beginner/intermediate HTML and very basic CSS. But I'm looking to learn multiple new languages!

<h3>Languages I'm interested in learning/improving:</h3>

- Web Design: HTML, CSS & JavaScript
- Game Design: C#, Java, & some C++
- Other: C++

<h3>Fun fact, I'm also interested in content creation and graphic design!</h3>
